first website using media queries

Created this website by going through an online tutorial on SuperHi. I familiarized myself with HTML/CSS using the 
code editor on SuperHi. Then I decided to migrate my work into a code editor so I can see my results live. 
I experimented with using media queries to get the content to adjust to the width of a device.
